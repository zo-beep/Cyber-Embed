/*
 * Quadrature rotary encoder decoder.
 *
 * Faithful port of the Flipper-Zero-ESP32-Port target_input.c encoder
 * driver (encoder_poll()), including its sampling model, not just its
 * decode math:
 *
 *   - This is PURE POLLING, not interrupt-driven, exactly like Flipper's
 *     driver. poll() must be called from a fixed-cadence loop -- Flipper
 *     runs encoder_poll() on its own dedicated thread every 4ms,
 *     decoupled from GUI/app work; here poll() is called the same way,
 *     from a small dedicated FreeRTOS task (see taskEncoderPoll() in
 *     main.cpp) at a higher priority than the render loop, every 4ms,
 *     so a busy redraw can never delay sampling A/B. No attachInterrupt/
 *     ISR is used anywhere here.
 *   - Each poll() call takes exactly one gpio level sample of A and B
 *     and compares it against the level remembered from the previous
 *     poll() call. There is no edge queue and no loop inside poll() --
 *     it is a single compare-and-return, matching Flipper's function
 *     body exactly.
 *   - A direct, deliberate consequence of that (same as Flipper): if the
 *     encoder is spun fast enough to pass through more than one
 *     transition between two poll() calls, the intermediate transitions
 *     are simply never observed -- not queued, not caught up on later,
 *     just gone. This is not a speed check; it falls straight out of
 *     sample-based (not event-based) reading at a fixed cadence, same
 *     as the original.
 *   - Mechanical encoders bounce; naively reacting to "A changed, check
 *     B" produces false reverse steps. This tracks all 4 valid AB
 *     transitions via a lookup table and only counts a step on a
 *     *valid* transition, skipping (ignoring) anything else as bounce.
 *   - Steps are accumulated and a position change is only committed
 *     once a full detent's worth of valid transitions has been seen,
 *     blocking partial/half-detent noise from ever reaching callers.
 *   - No time-based idle/staleness reset exists here, same as Flipper --
 *     it does not exist in target_input.c's encoder logic either.
 *
 * Drop-in replacement for the RotaryEncoder library's getPosition():
 * call poll() once per fixed-rate InputHandler() pass, and read
 * getPosition() exactly as before.
