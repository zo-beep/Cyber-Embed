# :shark: Bruce

Bruce is a versatile ESP32 firmware packed with offensive-security tools, built to make Red Team operations fast and portable.

It also supports [M5Stack](https://shop.m5stack.com), [LILYGO](https://lilygo.cc) , [RockBase IoT](https://www.rockbaseiot.com) and [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com) products, and works great with the Cardputer, Sticks, M5Cores, T-Decks and T-Embeds.

# RF REAPER

**RF REAPER** is our custom PCB devkit, purpose-built for Bruce!

Every major feature works natively, right out of the box. Sub-GHz, NFC/RFID, IR, 2.4GHz(NRF), GPS-ready, and a microSD, all driven by a beefy ESP32-S3 (16MB Flash / 8MB PSRAM). Tons of GPIOs via the AW9523 expander plus Flipper Zero & iButton header compatibility mean you can hack, mod, and build on it endlessly. Want a specific function? Ask us with an issue, we'll check it.

👉 **[Buy the RF REAPER and official boards](https://shop.bruce.computer)**

**Check our fully open-source hardware too:** https://bruce.computer/boards

More custom devkit boards coming soon! Stay across our communities!

## :building_construction: How to install

### The easiest way to install Bruce is using our official Web Flasher!

### Check out: https://bruce.computer/flasher

Alternatively, you can download the latest binary from releases or actions and flash locally using esptool.py

```sh
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyACM0 write_flash 0x00000 Bruce-<device>.bin
```

**For m5stack devices**

If you already use M5Launcher to manage your m5stack device, you can install it with OTA

Or you can burn it directly from the [m5burner tool](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/download), just search for 'Bruce' (My official builds will be uploaded by "owner" and have photos.) on the device category you want to and click on burn

² CYD have a LITE_VERSION version for Launcher Compatibility
¹ Core, CYD and StickCs Bad-USB: [here](https://wiki.bruce.computer/features/others/#badusb)

_LITE_VERSION_: TelNet, SSH, WireGuard, ScanHosts, RawSniffer, Brucegotchi, BLEBacon, BLEScan and Interpreter are NOT available for M5Launcher Compatibility

## :sparkles: Why and how does it look?

Bruce stems from a keen observation within the community focused on devices like Flipper Zero. While these devices offered a glimpse into the world of offensive security, there was a palpable sense that something more could be achieved without being that overpriced, particularly with the robust and modular hardware ecosystem provided by ESP32 Devices, Lilygo and M5Stack products.
